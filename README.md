# 📈 Crypto Arbitrage Monitor
# primitive_fast_arbi_bot
Arbitrage bot with the usage of asynchronous methods of data fetching

‼️‼️ DISCLAIMER ‼️‼️ this bot is most likely useless in real-world trading due to the use of "last price" prices fetching method. Plus it does not include depth of market and possible token mismatching, the only token confirmation method is ticker name. 

This project monitors price discrepancies (arbitrage opportunities) across three centralized exchanges (**Binance**, **OKX**, and **Bybit**) using their public APIs. It fetches live spot prices (last price), normalizes data into a common format, and identifies profitable trading spreads.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Asynchronous fetching from Binance, OKX, and Bybit
- 🔄 Unified JSON structure with exchange-specific parsers
- 🧠 Arbitrage detection based on configurable price spread
- 📝 JSON logging for structured data and live opportunity printouts
- 🔧 Easy to expand to more exchanges or pair filters

## 📂 Project Structure

- main.py # Main async loop for fetching and analysis
- parsers.py # Exchange-specific parser classes (e.g. BinanceParser)
- check_bin.py # List of Binance trading pairs to include (‼️‼️because Binance API call still returns many pairs that were delisted, this issue exists only with Binance)
- prices_binance.json # Fetched raw data (auto-generated)
- prices_okx.json  # Fetched raw data (auto-generated)
- prices_bybit.json  # Fetched raw data (auto-generated)
- arbi_main_file.json # Unified data ready for arbitrage analysis

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies:
  - `aiohttp`
  - `aiofiles`

Install with:

```bash
pip install aiohttp aiofiles


▶️ Usage
Run the script:

python main.py

Output (every 5 seconds):

✅✅✅ Arbitrage opportunity found!!! ✅✅✅
ETHUSDT
Buy on binance_price: 1865.55
Sell on bybit_price: 1890.21
Spread: 1.32%

⚙️ Customization
Symbol Filtering: Binance symbols are filtered using bin_pair_list in check_bin.py

Spread Thresholds: Adjust min_spread_threshold and max_spread_threshold in arb_opportunity()

Add New Exchange: Implement a parser in parsers.py and add it to CEX_CLASSES
